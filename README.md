Here is the link to the Github project titled MealApp https://github.com/AshvaanSurujbally/MealAPP

REPORT:
This app has been created for a close friend Hera. She has been struggling lately to decide what food to eat on her busy days. She has approached me to help her with this issue. she has asked me to develop an app that  
can help her decide what to cook/eat. The main purpose of the app is that it should be able for her to input the time of day and it will display appropriate meal suggestionsâ€™ inputs will be Morning, Mid-morning,
afternoon, Mid-afternoon, dinner and snack. One of the major considerations that I have taken into account is casing app will work with any casing as long it is a valid input. I have designed the app to be simple and user 
friendly. I have done this due to the fact that it needs to be saving Hera time. The app has two buttons, a simple UI with not too much going. The use of GitHub makes this process easier as it accessible to anyone and it is
a simple process to post and if the was needed the format of GitHub will allow me to post this app on the google play store with little to no hassle.
