# Meal Suggestion App

This simple Android application suggests meal ideas based on the time of day entered by the user.

## Overview

The app provides meal suggestions for the following times:

* Morning
* Mid-morning
* Afternoon
* Mid-afternoon
* Dinner
* Desserts
* Snack

Users input the time of day into a text field, and upon pressing the "Go" button, relevant meal suggestions are displayed. A "Reset" button clears the input field and the suggestions.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the Meal Suggestion App on your Android device or emulator.
2.  In the text field, enter the desired time of day (e.g., "Morning", "Dinner", "Snack"). Note that the input is not case-sensitive.
3.  Tap the "Go" button.
4.  The app will display meal suggestions in the text view below the buttons.
5.  To clear the input and suggestions, tap the "Reset" button.
6.  If an invalid time of day is entered, or if the input field is left empty, a toast message will appear prompting the user to enter a valid time.

REPORT:

This app has been created for a close friend Hera. She has been struggling lately to decide what food to eat on her busy days. She has approached me to help her with this issue. she has asked me to develop an app that can help her decide what to cook/eat. The main purpose of the app is that it should be able for her to input the time of day and it will display appropriate meal suggestions.The inputs will be Morning, Midmorning,
afternoon, Mid-afternoon, dinner and snack. One of the major considerations that I have taken into account is casing, the app will work with any casing as long as it is a valid input. I have designed the app to be simple and user 
friendly. I have done this due to the fact that it needs to be saving Hera time. The app has two buttons, a simple UI with not too much going. The use of GitHub makes this process easier as it accessible to anyone and it is
a simple process to post and if the was needed the format of GitHub will allow me to post this app on the google play store with little to no hassle.
